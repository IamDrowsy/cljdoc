# Documentation Tooling in Other Language Communities

While building this we should make an effort to look left and right
and see where we can draw inspiration or maybe avoid one or the other
pitfal.

Many people pointed out that Elixir has excellent documentation
tooling and [hexdocs.pm](https://hexdocs.pm) has certainly inspired
this project.

Some suggestions what to look at have been made in replies to [a tweet
of mine](https://twitter.com/martinklepsch/status/953696207465013248)
and another [tweet by
@mjackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/953818596211294208).

**Note** I'm mostly interested in language-wide tools, many
(especially popular) projects have their own ways of publishing
documentation and this is great but the goal is not to make the most
versatile tool ever but something that serves the 99% of projects.
That said looking at it does not hurt in many cases.

### Questions to ask / Template

- Are previous versions of the documentation kept available?
- What does the process of publishing new documentation look like?
- How is non code-based documentation integrated? (Tutorials, Guides, etc.)

### Rust

- https://docs.rs/im/9.0.0/im/

### Elixir

- https://hexdocs.pm/plug/readme.html

### Racket

### Elm

### Cocoa / iOS

- http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AFNetworking/3.1.0/
