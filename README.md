### What is this

See this [ClojureVerse thread](https://clojureverse.org/t/creating-a-central-documentation-repository-website-codox-complications/1287/) 
about a central documentation hub for Clojure similar to Elixir's https://hexdocs.pm/.


You can run what's inside by running

```sh
boot -vv build-docs --project sparkledriver --version 0.2.2 target
open target/codox-docs/index.html
```

After that `target/` will contain a codox build for the project at the given version.

## Progress

#### HOSTING

- [x] setup s3 bucket / static website using [Confetti](https://github.com/confetti-clj/confetti)
- [x] sync files generated by `build-docs` to S3

#### SERVICE + ISOLATION

- [ ] create Docker setup to run `build-docs`
- [ ] create an API server that runs the Docker setup
- [ ] copy created files to host, upload to S3 (so that AWS keys are not exposed in Docker env)

#### API DOCS

- [ ] derive source-uri 
  - probably needs parsing of project.clj or build.boot or perhaps we can derive source locations by overlaying jar contents
  - :face_with_head_bandage: from quick testing it seems that getting this to work with codox could be hard
  - Grimoire data contains source so perhaps source URI becomes less important
  - still would be nice to jump to the entire source file
- [x] give grimoire and related tools a go
  - Grimoire notes / questions
    - Building docs from jar vs src â€” what are the tradeoffs?
    - Are there any fundamental issues with grimoire that could become problematic later?
    - How do you build docs for a [prj v] when another version is already on the classpath?
- [ ] throw an error or something if grimoire does not find *anything*
- [ ] think about how different platforms can be combined in API docs
- [ ] build static site generator or SPA that runs on top of grimoire data

#### GITHUB + NON-API DOCS

- [x] read Github URL from pom.xml or Clojars
- [x] clone repo, copy `doc` directory, provide to codox
- [x] try to check out Git repo at specific tag for `doc/` stuff; warn if no tags
- [ ] figure out what other metadata should be imported
- [ ] Figure out how to deal with changes between tagged releases
  - We probably don't want to pick up API changes since people commonly push development progress straight to `master`
  - Picking up changes to `doc/` would be nice and the above problem probably applies a little less
  - When updating `doc/` triggered by Github commits we need to derive the correct version
    - Take latest "RELEASE" version on Clojars?
    - Take version specified by most recent tag?

#### LONG SHOTS

- [ ] think about discovery of projects with same group-id
- [ ] think about how something like dynadoc (interactive docs) could be integrated
- [ ] think about how stack style REPL examples could be integrated

#### BOT

- [ ] notify people that there are api docs available for a jar they just published 
- [ ] nag them to add some plain text documentation/guides
